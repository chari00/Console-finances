## 4. What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

- To define a variable;

let count = finances.length;
let monthlyDifferenceTotal = 0;
let greatestIncrease = 0;
let greatestDecrease = 0;
let greatestIncreaseMonth = "Date";

- To create a for loop;

for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
const element = array[index];
}

- To print in console;

console.log("Average Change: " + averageTotal);
console.log(
"Greatest Increase: " + greatestIncreaseMonth + ": $" + greatestIncrease
);
